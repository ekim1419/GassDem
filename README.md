- Description:
   - GassDem (Gassmann Differential effective medium) is a MATLAB program for modeling anisotropic seismic properties from rock microstructure using differential effective medium (DEM) theory and Gassmann’s (1951) poroelastic relationship. We provide the example of DEM modeling, which is set as the default, and the user manual to replicate the example using the GassDem graphical user interface, or using a MATLAB script. GassDem graphical user interface (GUI) is designed using the MATLAB (R2016b) App Designer for calculating the elastic stiffness tensor of the porous effective medium with fluid inclusions based on the DEM theory and Gassmann’s poroelastic relationship. Using the elastic stiffness tensor from GassDem, seismic velocities in the direction of reference axes and the inverse of maximum quality factor can be calculated.
